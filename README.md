# Number Typing
A little program that helps you practice typing numbers faster.

Well, *it* doesn't force you to type faster, *you* do.

The program ends and gives you a score when you don't type in the right number.

This isn't a complicated program by any means, but I thought it would be fun to put here anyways.
