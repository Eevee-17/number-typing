# Number Typing
This includes a little program that helps you practice typing numbers faster and a program that helps you practice doing math in hexidecimal.

Well, *it* doesn't force you to type faster or be better at math, *you* do.

The programs end and give you a score when you don't type in the right number.

These aren't complicated programs by any means, but I thought they would be fun to put here anyways.
